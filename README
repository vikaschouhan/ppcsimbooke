ppc_sim_booke
---------------------------------------------
The purpose of this project is to explore an instruction set simulator for booke powerpc architectures in c++.
The reference core is freescale e500v2.

Features :-
1. ISS is being designed in c++ as a shared library. A python based interface/wrapper is also planned.
3. The simulator can only be compiled with GCC since it heavily uses x86/x86_64 inline assembly to map some of the ppc instructions directly to x86 instructions.
4. It's not portable across platforms ( for the same reason mentioned above ) and would only work on an x86_64 host.
