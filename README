ppc_sim_booke
---------------------------------------------
The purpose of this project is to explore an experimental instruction set simulator for booke powerpc architectures in c++.
The reference core is freescale e500v2.

Features :-
1. ISS is being designed in c++ as a shared library with a python frontend ( developed using boost::python ).
3. The simulator can only be compiled with GCC since it heavily uses x86/x86_64 inline assembly to map some of the ppc instructions directly to x86 instructions.
4. It's not portable across platforms ( for the same reason mentioned above ) and would only work on an x86_64 host.

Dependencies :-
1. boost::python.
2. ipython/python.

Several testcases are there in sim/tests directory, which exercise various functionalities for different modules. To compile, go to sim/tests and issue make.
To compile the python module, go to sim/wrapper/python and issue make.
