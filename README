ppc_sim_booke
---------------------------------------------
The purpose of this project is to explore an experimental instruction set simulator for booke powerpc architectures in C++.
The reference core is freescale e500v2.

Features :-
1. ISS is being designed in C++ as a shared library with a python frontend ( developed using boost::python ).
3. The simulator can only be compiled with GCC, since it uses x86/x86_64 inline assembly at some places 
   to map some of the ppc instructions directly to x86 instructions.
4. It's not portable across platforms ( for the same reason mentioned above ) and would only work on an x86[_64] host.
5. To facilitate loading of elf files directly into memory, the memory interface now supports an elf-loader.

Dependencies :-
1. boost C++ library     ( www.boost.org )
2. ipython/python.       ( www.python.org )
3. elfio C++ library     ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/elfio )       

Several testcases are there in sim/tests directory, which exercise various functionalities for different modules. To compile, go to sim/tests and issue make.
To compile the python module, go to sim/wrapper/python and issue make.
