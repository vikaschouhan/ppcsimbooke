A framework for bare metal powerpc applications/tests.
============================================================

This framework uses newlib embedded C library and somethings ofcourse don't work for obvious reasons.
Problems / broken functionalities.

1. scanf family of funtions won't work.
2. printf seems to be either broken for float/double specifiers or the support is entirely missing.
