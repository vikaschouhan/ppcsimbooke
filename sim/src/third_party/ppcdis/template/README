NOTE : Very Very important

This file was converted from ppc-opc.c from GNU binutils project into a header format suitable for inclusion in our project.
This file contains lots and lots of macros, due to which there are many instances of namespace collisions when using with some external C++ libraries like boost.
To avoid the namespace collisions, this file is converted instead to a template format. Actual header file will be generated after resolving all macros ( which it contains ).
To generate the actual ppc-opc.h header file, we just do a "gcc -E template/ppc-opc.hxx >! ppc-opc.h" from the parent directory. This header file needs to be generated whenever this template file is updated.
