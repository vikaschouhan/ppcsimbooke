A framework for bare metal powerpc applications/tests.
============================================================

This framework uses newlib embedded C library and somethings ofcourse don't work for obvious reasons.
Problems / broken functionalities.

1. [s]scanf family of funtions won't work.
2. [s]printf family of functions seem to be broken. It can't parse %d, %f specifiers etc correctly.
